At this point I have three rows of rotated cars in the sprite sheet: each has wheels pointing in different directions.

I’m currently doing the skid marks as sprites (which is why they disappear over time) partly because it was easy to get going, and partly to try to figure out some performance limits (~350 sprites in the GIF below, 25 of which are collidable and have my custom physics applied). Will be drawing skids marks straight to screen at some point in the future.

Short term goal is to have some lap races/time-trials, plus a “driving test” or “stunt driving” mode which is what you’re seeing here.

Codename is currently: Crank Turismo

At this point you can’t hear my great synth-powered car engine and skidding sfx!
