I have redone the collision/rebound physics, and car visual and steering is now affected when colliding - makes collisions feel really physical. Tyres and Cone obstacles have different collision properties so they feel different when you hit them. It's a lot of fun to simply drive around and knock into things, which makes me confident I'm onto something good here.

**1 June 2020.** Iâ€™m now happy enough with the handling, time to get some gameplay in here. At this point the game is running at the Playdate SDK default of 30fps.

First playable demo released to Playdate Developer Preview group!

**"Fastest Time Challenge"**

-   hit all 8 cones as quickly as possible
-   obstacles getting stuck under your car will slow you down!
