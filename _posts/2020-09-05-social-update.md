The launch of this Patreon for Daily Driver also sees the game's [topic on TIGSource Forums](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=70808.msg1428724#msg1428724) as the first Playdate game!

And also [on IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/games/daily-driver) as perhaps the first Playdate game? Though I do see fellow devs and Patreon Creators [RNG Party](https://www.patreon.com/rngparty) are already listed but they are yet to add their current Playdate game.
