Samurai Mech サムライ・メック preserved!   
  
I've been digging up old Macintosh games, and this search has rested in the website for the classic Japanese game [#samuraimech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/samuraimech?src=hash)coming back online after over a decade! Thanks Ritsuko! [(patreon.com/posts/48174477)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/48174477) [(samuraimech.net)](https://samuraimech.net/) Samurai Mech サムライ・メック is a Japanese sci-fi RPGs set in a future-medieval-space Japan. You assume the role of the eponymous Samurai Mech over the course of 40h of exploration/battle/puzzle gameplay.

You can practice your swordsmanship at the dojo, and upgrade your Samurai Mech suit with parts obtained through winning battles. The first game has a whole city to explore whilst you solve a mystery around a group of ninjas.

In the sequel サムライ・メックII・天 you are a bounty hunter in an archipelago colony at the edge of the universe. An ancient castle, an amusement park, an adult ballroom and a giant corporation. New scenario, freedom, mech system, combat, and colour/mono graphics!
