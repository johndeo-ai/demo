These beautiful cards were created in 1983 using only characters, without bitmap graphics. This was because the Sharp MZ-700, like many home computers of its era, couldn't do bitmap graphics.

Here is a download of the [Playscii](http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/) art files for the above cards: [Sharp MZ-700 Hanafuda.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j8lyoi6twdderl/Sharp%20MZ-700%20Hanafuda.zip?dl=0)

Also included are a set of blank cards so you can try creating something yourself.

I encourage you to at least try as you'll encounter some of the genius design decisions made by the original creator!
