The Collector prototype didn't end up being as fun as I had hoped, but I thought it was interestingly that it felt a little like driving. So I wondered whether it would change the feeling by putting some different graphics on top of it. I ripped some temporary graphics from the Atari arcade game Badlands and added one simple collision detection rule and there it was! The first recognisable driving game that would serve as the basis for Daily Driver.
