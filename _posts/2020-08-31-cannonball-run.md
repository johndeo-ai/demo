This was a result of my continued work implementing different surface frictions, and I mistakenly set the cones to not be affected by friction and thus never slow down. Hitting them a few times was enough to get them moving at a good speed, and then I drove around the screen.

What I didn't appreciate is that my collision model uses elastic collision, which allows the car to knock stuff over in a quite pleasing way where the car takes a little bit of a knock. But if those things are moving fast enough, as the cones are here, then any collision will also affect the car to a larger degree. You can see the car being pushed around by the out of control traffic cones.
