I just finished increasing the size of toolbar icons in Deneba artWorks from 24x16 to 24x24.

Easily done by finding the dialog that contains these icons, and resizing the canvas of each related PICT.

Several trips between ResEdit and Photoshop (version 1.0!) and I was done.

This is to make the tool buttons easier to tap with my thumb when running System 7 on iPad.

I love this takable nature of early Macintosh systems. Palm OS is very similar in that regard.

Why moan about an app not being to your liking when you can DIY!?
