Some fellow Playdate developers commented that at this point the game reminded them of _Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road_, _Super Sprint_ and even _Rocket League_.

A few of my influences for vibe:

- Atariâ€™s _Sprint_ series, including _Badlands_
- _Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road_
- _Wild Wheels_ (a [car soccer game](https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/ball-sports-with-vehicles) that pre-dates _Rocket League_ by ~20 years)

And for gameplay:

- _ExciteBots: Trick Racing_
- _Mario Kart DS/Wii_
- _Power Drive_
- _Richard Burns Rally_
- _The Italian Job: LA Heist_
- _Pro Rally_
- _Runabout_ series

...so many more, some of which are not even driving games!
