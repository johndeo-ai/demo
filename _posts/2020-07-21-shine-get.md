Added steering assist, which locks your final steering direction to one of 16 directions, rather than allowing any angle. This prevents over steer when trying to turn to the specific directions required in a level. Of course this is optional; it is variable and can be switched off if the player does not want it.

**25 July 2020.** I added another type of object, one that disappears upon collision meaning that it is collectable. It's a kind of coin with a coin-collecting sound effect.

No changes to physics have been made in a long time, but I guess on this level there are no collisions so the car is mostly at full throttle and so seems a bit more responsive than previously?

Iâ€™ve already done multiple car types with different handling and sprites. Still more to do though.
